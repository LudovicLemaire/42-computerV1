# ComputerV1
The program solves polynomial equations of degree less than or equal to 2.

## How to use
Simply launch the computerV1.exe in a shell, with the equation as argument (or without argument, you will be allowed to write it directly in the command line).
The equation MUST have one of these 2 forms.
 - 5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0
or
 - 2x^2 + 9x - 5 = 0

You can change the order, dual both form, put many arguments of same degree (but no / *). It can be such a hell as below
 - x + 42 - 9x - 5 + 4 - 2x^2 + 4 + 4x^2 = 0 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 45 + 4x + 9x

Here is an example of result of the program:
